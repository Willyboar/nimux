### MVC Framework for Nim  
  

An attempt to create an MVC web framework built in [nim](https://nim-lang.org/).  
  

This project would be an attempt at Result Driven Development. That means that first, we will create the application and next we will create the framework to create, run and deploy it.  
  

This project can't be a one-man show and any help and contribution are welcome because I am not a professional developer but a hobbyist.  
  

My target is to create something that will attract first of all new users for nim and framework, who will become contributors in the future, helping the community grow.  
  

Also, I intend to move this under a new organization if a lot of people saw an interest in it.  
  

If you want to contact me you can find me on nim gitter channel and or if you want to propose something you can open an issue.  
  
  

## Roadmap
